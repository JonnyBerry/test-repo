      Lazarus is a dystopian science fiction comic book series created by writer Greg Rucka and artist Michael Lark.
      The two began developing the idea in 2012 and partnered with colorist Santi Arcas to finish the art.
      Image Comics has been publishing the book since the first issue was released on June 23, 2013.
       Other creators were brought in later to assist with lettering and inking.
       A six-issue spin-off limited series, Lazarus: X+66, was released monthly in 2017 between issues 26 and 27 of the regular series.
       Rucka initially said the series could run for up to 150 issues, but later reduced the estimate by half. Lazarus is being collected into paperback and hardcover editions,
       which sell better than the monthly issues.
